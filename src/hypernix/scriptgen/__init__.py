"""hypernix.scriptgen — build training scripts, in a GUI or from the CLI.

    hnx scriptgen                     open the GUI
    hnx scriptgen --cli -o train.py   generate headless

Forty-three parameters across six groups, modelled on the nano-nano 5.1
trainer's surface: learning rates and warmup ratios, epoch and step
controls, batch and micro-batch sizing, gradient accumulation, loss
functions and optimisers — plus the HyperNix-specific parts (the
Pressure Cooker family, 6-bit momentum modes, and the Pascal
auto-tuner).

Four modules, and the split matters:

* :mod:`~hypernix.scriptgen.params` — one definition per parameter, used
  to build the widget, validate the value, and emit the script. Defining
  them separately is how a GUI offers a learning rate the generated
  script rejects.
* :mod:`~hypernix.scriptgen.templates` — generate a whole script, inject
  a config block into an existing one, or emit just the values.
* :mod:`~hypernix.scriptgen.theme` — dark slate, charcoal, obsidian and
  HyperNix red, with the "no purple" rule and WCAG contrast enforced by
  :func:`~hypernix.scriptgen.theme.audit_palette` rather than by taste.
* :mod:`~hypernix.scriptgen.widgets` — the dual slider, log slider and
  toggle switch Tk does not have.

:class:`~hypernix.scriptgen.app.FormModel` holds the values, validation
and preview and imports no GUI toolkit, so all of that is testable on a
headless machine — which is also the machine the training usually runs
on.
