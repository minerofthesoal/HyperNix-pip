"""scriptgen.theme — dark slate, charcoal, obsidian, and HyperNix red.

One palette, defined once, with contrast ratios checked rather than
eyeballed. Tkinter has no theming system worth the name, so every widget
gets its colours explicitly; having them in one place is what keeps a
40-widget form from drifting into four slightly different greys.

The constraint
--------------
Dark neutrals and one red. No purple, no neon. That rules out the entire
family of "dark theme" accents that lean violet — a blue-grey pushed far
enough becomes purple, so the neutrals here are *warm*: their red channel
is at or above their blue channel at every step. :func:`audit_palette`
enforces that as an actual check, because "no purple" is easy to agree
with and easy to violate by picking a nice-looking `#2a2a3e`.

Contrast
--------
Every foreground/background pair used for text is checked against WCAG
AA (4.5:1 for body, 3:1 for large text and UI edges) by
:func:`audit_palette`. A dark theme is where contrast failures hide:
mid-grey on dark-grey looks tasteful in a mockup and is unreadable on a
dim laptop screen.
