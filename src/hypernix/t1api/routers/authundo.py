"""``/t1/auth/undo`` and ``/t1/auth/redo``.

These live at ``/t1/auth/...`` because that is the path the release
specifies. The rest of this API's authentication surface is at
``/auth/...`` (with T1-specific operations under ``/auth/t1/...``), so
the same two operations are also registered there as aliases — one
implementation, two routes, because a client that has learned
``/auth/t1/rotate`` should not have to learn a differently-shaped path
for the operation that reverses it.

What undo actually does
-----------------------
It reverses the last recorded authentication change: a rotation, a
promotion, a scope change, a revocation, an SSPKID assignment, or a plan
change. The history is a stack (see :mod:`hypernix.t1api.authhistory`),
recording an inverse rather than a snapshot, and it refuses to record an
operation it could not actually reverse.

Both endpoints are admin-only and both are audited *before* the mutation
is attempted as well as after, because "who tried to undo the admin
promotion" is a question worth being able to answer even when the
attempt failed.
